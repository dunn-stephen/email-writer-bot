def generate_email(prompt):
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
        max_tokens=1000,
        messages=[{
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"Write an email: {prompt}"
        }],
        system="You are Stephen Dunn's email assistant. [Include full instructions here]"
    )
    return response.content[0].text

# Example usage

```
Then update your project files with any new patterns.

### Best Practices
