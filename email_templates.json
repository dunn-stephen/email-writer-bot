When you select the 10/30 to 11/30 range, the open rate is calculated using all sends and opens within that period. However, when the start date shifts to 10/31, there are fewer sends but a relatively high number of opens and clicks during the remaining period. This imbalance results in an inflated open rate for that timeframe.\n\nI've included a screenshot below to help illustrate this.
